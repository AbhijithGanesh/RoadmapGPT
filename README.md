# RoadmapGPT
Get a roadmap and never get lost again. Basically, the app aims to give you a customized and comprehensive roadmap for all topics, helping you learn faster and better. See the image below for some ideas. Also, try this [bot I made](https://poe.com/Roadmap) to better understand what this is. I believe that if done properly, this could be useful rather than "yet-another-useless-API-wrapper"

### some work i did today

this is how it'll kinda end up looking like, tbh i like the ui/ux .. it's minimalistic and good enough for some 10 lines of py script.
if you can flex your development skills, make a PR (pls do)

# todo

im lazy, but you're not (hopefully).

the plan is to make this thing better by better prompting, maybe langchain could help. idk should see.
also we could get this thing running with streamlit or flet. 



(i had this repo as private for so long for no real reason, idk why. I'm pretty sure this is a good thing to work on for fun)

- i'll contribute to this after my uni finals.
  ideas as welcomed. we're just having fun here.
