# RoadmapGPT
Get a roadmap and never get lost again. RoadmapGPT aims to give you a customized and comprehensive roadmap for all topics, helping you learn faster and better. See the image below for some ideas. Also, try this [bot I made](https://poe.com/Roadmap) to better understand what this is. I believe that if done properly, this could be useful rather than "yet-another-useless-API-wrapper"

## TODO

- [ ] Host the website (will do tomorrow).
- [ ] A better graph rendering (If you're a js developer and interested, make a PR)
- [ ] Improve the backend with better prompts, asking the user to give topics he is familiar with already to make it more customizable.

The frontend is okayish, it is not necessary to overdo it, but minimalistic UI/UX designs are appreciated. Also will need a better frontend when more complicated user inputs are to be taken.
